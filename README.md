Instructions for getting this to compile and run:
1. Edit 'makefile' and change the variable 'TEST_FILE' to a file listed in the directory 'tests'. 
2. Now make. The idea is that you compile and link all in the src directory with **ONE** file in the tests directory.
3. Run the .out file you've created in the build directory, making sure a directory called 'data' has been created in the root. The .out file should have the same name as 'TEST_FILE'.
4. Run one of the 3 'plot_' Python files in the src directory to visualise the data.
